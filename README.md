•Developed a Sudoku solver using JavaScript that utilizes a backtracking algorithm, to recursively explore each placement
•Implemented efficient helper functions to validate placements in rows, and columns,by checking for duplicate numbers.
•This algorithm allows to solve any sudoku with the time complexity of O(9^(N*N)).
